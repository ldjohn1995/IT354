    <h2> Vaules and Types </h2>
    What are vaules and types ? Types are a group of operations that store different types of data. There are
    six types that are considered primitives. The following includes a String, a number, undefined, null, symbol,
    and boolean. A string is a type of data that contains letters/words. A number is a type of data that stores any
    type of number. Undefined data type  stores data inside a variable that hasn't been giving a vaule yet. Null
    is a data type that stores no vaule. Lastly, boolean is datatype that stores true or false vaules. In javascript,
    a vaule means <br>
<h6> String</h6>
    var name = "lasean";

  <h2> Unary operator & hoisting </h2>
    What is an unary operator ? A unary operator is one that takes a single operand/argument and performs an operation.
    The different types of unary operators are:
    unary plus(+) - tries to convert the operand into a Number
    unary negation(-) - Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after
    Logical Not(!) - converts to boolean vaule then negates import
    Increment(++)- adds to variables
    decrement(--) - subtract to variables
    delete - delete object or variable


    What is hoisting? hoisting is where varables and functions declartions are moved to the top of their scope before the
    code execution.<br>
